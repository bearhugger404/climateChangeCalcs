# Climate Change Everyday Scenarios
Problem: 
1) It is difficult for people to how their mundane everyday activities impact the climate
2) It is difficult for them to appreciate those impacts in something familiar & tangible

These files are an attempt at addressing these concerns. I have taken some everyday situations such as trying to drive faster to reach office few minutes sooner or buying coffee from a coffee shop, etc & assessed their carbon footprints. These footprints are in kg of CO2 form. I've personally found it difficult to imagine & measure these carbon emmissions by mass. I've therefore converted these emmissions to the time (in days, months, etc) an average tree might taken to absorb it back to the soil (sequesteration).

Each file has an Framework tab with some details on how to read the calculations.

Next steps/help needed:
1) Critique & modify the references I've used in my calculations
2) Identify more scenarios & try solving them using the framework
3) Adopt the framework to other locales. The carbon emmissions in the electricity grid is that of Ontario (my local province). This needs to be changed for other regions in order to reflect the realities for other regions
4) If there's sufficient interest, I'd like to collaborate to build a webapp & mobile to provide on-demand & cutomized results to users

Note: The outputs are ballpark numbers & my intention is to have them serve as an indication to help with daily decision making.
